# ADXL345-Tilt-Detection-with-LEDs
This project uses an ADXL345 accelerometer to detect tilt and indicate movement with LEDs. The Arduino reads acceleration values and activates LEDs based on tilt direction. It helps in motion sensing applications like robotics and alert systems. The Serial Monitor displays real-time acceleration data for debugging and sensitivity adjustments.
